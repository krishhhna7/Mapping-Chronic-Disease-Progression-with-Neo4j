My main project was about predicting chronic diseases with SVM and Logistic Regression.
Neo4j helped me generate graph-based features like:

Number of co-occurring symptoms before diagnosis

Shortest path between lifestyle factors and diseases

Shared progression patterns among similar patients

These features improved the explainability of my ML models. Instead of just numbers, I could trace paths in the graph that explained why a patient was flagged at risk.
